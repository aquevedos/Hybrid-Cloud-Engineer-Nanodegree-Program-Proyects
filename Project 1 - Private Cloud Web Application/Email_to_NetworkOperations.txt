Dear Team of Network Operations:
My name is Anita and in response to your requirement, I have configured all necessary according to the request

The network infrastructure will consist of separate production and development networks. 
The production network will be managed using IPAM/DHCP from an IP Pool provided by the 
Network Operations group. The production network will be on vlan 0, using the 172.31.0.0/24 network. 
The IP Pool will use a Start address of 172.31.0.210 and an End address of 172.31.0.230. 
The development network will be unmanaged on VLAN 101 using the 172.31.101.0/24 network.


Respectfully
Anita Quevedo
