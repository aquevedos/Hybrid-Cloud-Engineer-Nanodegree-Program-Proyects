Dear Team of Systems Administration:
My name is Anita and in response to your requirement, I have configured all necessary according to the request

The basic testing resource requirements for each virtual machine in the 3-tier application stack will be the same. 
Microsoft SQL on Windows, has been chosen for the database tier and the application server and web server tiers will 
both be Linux based. Each virtual machine will be configured with 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM. For testing purposes 
you will need to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) using the public service, pool.ntp.org, and 8.8.8.8 
for the Domain Naming Service (DNS). You will also need to create a new storage container called Images 
to hold the Windows and CentOS virtual disk images (C:\Images) to be uploaded to the Image Service. 
The virtual machine naming convention will be based on a 2-3 letter representation, 
followed by the environment. Example: Database server for Production, use db-prod. 
Application for development, use app-dev, etcâ€¦
The production virtual machines, when created based on the previous criteria, should be duplicated to create an 
identical development environment.



Respectfully
Anita Quevedo
